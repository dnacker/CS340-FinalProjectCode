<h2>Description of entities:</h2>
<h3>Zone</h3>
<p>
    In rock climbing, there is a discipline known as bouldering. Boulders tend to fall off cliff bands in bunches.
    A bunch of boulders constitutes a zone. A zone is typically named after a town or geographic feature it is near.
    For example, near the town of Leavenworth in Washington there is a zone called "Leavenworth" that has many boulders.
    Zones have a name, country, state and quantity of climbs.
</p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>
    Each boulder has several paths to climb it, typically called problems. A problem has a difficulty (0 - 16), a zone that it is in,
    a list of styles that it is and the number of ascents that it has seen. Problems with many ascents tend to be popular
    problems since many people have climbed them.
</p>
<h3>Style</h3>
<p>
    Problems come in different styles. A problem may have multiple styles so this is kept track in a many-to-many table.
    Styles denote how the boulder might suit a particular climber. Some climbers have an easier time with powerful problems,
    while other climbers may have easier times with technical problems.
</p>
<h3>Climber</h3>
<p>
    The practitioners of bouldering are called climbers. They will use this database to log their climbing ascents.
    They have some identifying information like name, age, height and weight and then a local zone they call home.
</p>
<h3>Ascent</h3>
<p>
    Whenever a climber accomplishes a problem, this is known as an ascent. A climber can keep track of their progress in a logbook
    which details all the climbs they have sent. Some thoughts on extending this are to have this keep track of the date
    of the ascent as well as comments the climber has to say about the climb. Adding an ascent will increase both the number of ascents
    for that climber and the number of ascents the problem has seen.
